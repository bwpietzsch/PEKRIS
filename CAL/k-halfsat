+ examining the simulation results for calibrating krill_halfsat, it can not exceed 0.218 as after that no eggs are produced which is unrealistic
+ following Atkinson et al. (2006), half saturation constant should not fall below 0.082

Bahlburg et al. (2021):
+ using results of palmer scenario (closer chla availability to ours)
+ first spawning: in third summer (Dec-Jan)
+ max size: 46 mm with active metabolic scaling
+ max eggs: 21,100 with active metabolic scaling

best fit for this:
+ halfsat = 0.09
+ first repro: 1073 d / 09.12.3
+ max l: 45.9 mm
+ max eggs: 10,574 n
